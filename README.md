# 🤖 Phoenix

**Phoenix** is a flexible and extensible AI agent framework built with **Next.js** and **Vercel AI SDK**. It empowers developers and researchers to **build, test, and run AI agents** by combining custom prompts with dynamic tool execution — all in a sleek, browser-based interface.

Whether you're crafting a chatbot, autonomous agent, or a task-specific assistant, Agentix lets you wire up AI reasoning with real-world actions through pluggable tools.
